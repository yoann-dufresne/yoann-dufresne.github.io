abstract = {{\textcopyright} The Author(s) 2015. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Nucleic Acids Research. Since its creation in 2006, Norine remains the unique knowledgebase dedicated to non-ribosomal peptides (NRPs). These secondary metabolites, produced by bacteria and fungi, harbor diverse interesting biological activities (such as antibiotic, antitumor, siderophore or surfactant) directly related to the diversity of their structures. The Norine team goal is to collect the NRPs and provide tools to analyze them efficiently. We have developed a user-friendly interface and dedicated tools to provide a complete bioinformatics platform. The knowledgebase gathers abundant and valuable annotations on more than 1100 NRPs. To increase the quantity of described NRPs and improve the quality of associated annotations, we are now opening Norine to crowdsourcing. We believe that contributors from the scientific community are the best experts to annotate the NRPs they work on. We have developed MyNorine to facilitate the submission of new NRPs or modifications of stored ones. This article presents MyNorine and other novelties of Norine interface released since the first publication. Norine is freely accessible from the following URL: http://bioinfo.lifl.fr/NRP.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 The Authors. Since its first release in 2008, Norine remains the unique resource completely devoted to nonribosomal peptides (NRPs). They are very attractive microbial secondary metabolites, displaying a remarkable diversity of structure and functions. Norine (. http://bioinfo.lifl.fr/NRP) includes a database now containing more than 1160 annotated peptides and user-friendly interfaces enabling the querying of the database, through the annotations or the structure of the peptides. Dedicated tools are associated for structural comparison of the compounds and prediction of their biological activities. In this paper, we start by describing the knowledgebase and the dedicated tools. We then present some user cases to show how useful Norine is for the discovery of novel nonribosomal peptides.},

@article{Cordier2018,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 John Wiley  {\&}  Sons Ltd Biodiversity monitoring is the standard for environmental impact assessment of anthropogenic activities. Several recent studies showed that high-throughput amplicon sequencing of environmental DNA (eDNA metabarcoding) could overcome many limitations of the traditional morphotaxonomy-based bioassessment. Recently, we demonstrated that supervised machine learning (SML) can be used to predict accurate biotic indices values from eDNA metabarcoding data, regardless of the taxonomic affiliation of the sequences. However, it is unknown to which extent the accuracy of such models depends on taxonomic resolution of molecular markers or how SML compares with metabarcoding approaches targeting well-established bioindicator species. In this study, we address these issues by training predictive models upon five different ribosomal bacterial and eukaryotic markers and measuring their performance to assess the environmental impact of marine aquaculture on independent data sets. Our results show that all tested markers are yielding accurate predictive models and that they all outperform the assessment relying solely on taxonomically assigned sequences. Remarkably, we did not find any significant difference in the performance of the models built using universal eukaryotic or prokaryotic markers. Using any molecular marker with a taxonomic range broad enough to comprise different potential bioindicator taxa, SML approach can overcome the limits of taxonomy-based eDNA bioassessment.},

Motivation Advances in the sequencing of uncultured environmental samples, dubbed metagenomics, raise a growing need for accurate taxonomic assignment. Accurate identification of organisms present within a community is essential to understanding even the most elementary ecosystems. However, current high-throughput sequencing technologies generate short reads which partially cover full-length marker genes and this poses difficult bioinformatic challenges for taxonomy identification at high resolution. Results We designed MATAM, a software dedicated to the fast and accurate targeted assembly of short reads sequenced from a genomic marker of interest. The method implements a stepwise process based on construction and analysis of a read overlap graph. It is applied to the assembly of 16S rRNA markers and is validated on simulated, synthetic and genuine metagenomes. We show that MATAM outperforms other available methods in terms of low error rates and recovered fractions and is suitable to provide improved assemblies for precise taxonomic assignments.

@article{Dufresne2019,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2019 The Author(s). Background: High-throughput amplicon sequencing of environmental DNA (eDNA metabarcoding) has become a routine tool for biodiversity survey and ecological studies. By including sample-specific tags in the primers prior PCR amplification, it is possible to multiplex hundreds of samples in a single sequencing run. The analysis of millions of sequences spread into hundreds to thousands of samples prompts for efficient, automated yet flexible analysis pipelines. Various algorithms and software have been developed to perform one or multiple processing steps, such as paired-end reads assembly, chimera filtering, Operational Taxonomic Unit (OTU) clustering and taxonomic assignment. Some of these software are now well established and widely used by scientists as part of their workflow. Wrappers that are capable to process metabarcoding data from raw sequencing data to annotated OTU-to-sample matrix were also developed to facilitate the analysis for non-specialist users. Yet, most of them require basic bioinformatic or command-line knowledge, which can limit the accessibility to such integrative toolkits. Furthermore, for flexibility reasons, these tools have adopted a step-by-step approach, which can prevent an easy automation of the workflow, and hence hamper the analysis reproducibility. Results: We introduce SLIM, an open-source web application that simplifies the creation and execution of metabarcoding data processing pipelines through an intuitive Graphic User Interface (GUI). The GUI interact with well-established software and their associated parameters, so that the processing steps are performed seamlessly from the raw sequencing data to an annotated OTU-to-sample matrix. Thanks to a module-centered organization, SLIM can be used for a wide range of metabarcoding cases, and can also be extended by developers for custom needs or for the integration of new software. The pipeline configuration (i.e. the modules chaining and all their parameters) is stored in a file that can be used for reproducing the same analysis. Conclusion: This web application has been designed to be user-friendly for non-specialists yet flexible with advanced settings and extensibility for advanced users and bioinformaticians. The source code along with full documentation is available on the GitHub repository (https://github.com/yoann-dufresne/SLIM) and a demonstration server is accessible through the application website (https://trtcrd.github.io/SLIM/).},

@article{Dufresne2015,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015 Dufresne et al. Background: The monomeric composition of polymers is powerful for structure comparison and synthetic biology, among others. Many databases give access to the atomic structure of compounds but the monomeric structure of polymers is often lacking. We have designed a smart algorithm, implemented in the tool Smiles2Monomers (s2m), to infer efficiently and accurately the monomeric structure of a polymer from its chemical structure. Results: Our strategy is divided into two steps: first, monomers are mapped on the atomic structure by an efficient subgraph-isomorphism algorithm; second, the best tiling is computed so that non-overlapping monomers cover all the structure of the target polymer. The mapping is based on a Markovian index built by a dynamic programming algorithm. The index enables s2m to search quickly all the given monomers on a target polymer. After, a greedy algorithm combines the mapped monomers into a consistent monomeric structure. Finally, a local branch and cut algorithm refines the structure. We tested this method on two manually annotated databases of polymers and reconstructed the structures de novo with a sensitivity over 90 {\%}. The average computation time per polymer is 2 s. Conclusion: s2m automatically creates de novo monomeric annotations for polymers, efficiently in terms of time computation and sensitivity. s2m allowed us to detect annotation errors in the tested databases and to easily find the accurate structures. So, s2m could be integrated into the curation process of databases of small compounds to verify the current entries and accelerate the annotation of new polymers.

abstract = {Norine, the unique resource dedicated to nonribosomal peptides (NRPs), is now updated with a new pipeline to automate massive sourcing and enhance annotation. External databases are mined to extract NRPs that are not yet in Norine. To maintain a high data quality, successive filters are applied to automatically validate the NRP annotations and only validated data is inserted in the database. External databases were also used to complete annotations of NRPs already in Norine. Besides, annotation consistency inside Norine and between Norine and external sources have reported annotation errors. Some can be corrected automatically, while others need manual curation. This new approach led to the insertion of 539 new NRPs and the addition or correction of annotations of nearly all Norine entries. Two new tools to analyse the chemical structures of NRPs (rBAN) and to infer a molecular formula from the mass-to-charge ratio of an NRP (Kendrick Formula Predictor) were also integrated.

abstract = {Considering a set of intervals on the real line, an interval graph records these intervals as nodes and their intersections as edges. Identifying (i.e. merging) pairs of nodes in an interval graph results in a multiple-interval graph. Given only the nodes and the edges of the multiple-interval graph without knowing the underlying intervals, we are interested in the following questions. Can one determine how many intervals correspond to each node? Can one compute a walk over the multiple-interval graph nodes that reflects the ordering of the original intervals? These questions are closely related to linked-read DNA sequencing, where barcodes are assigned to long molecules whose intersection graph forms an interval graph. Each barcode may correspond to multiple molecules, which complicates downstream analysis, and corresponds to the identification of nodes of the corresponding interval graph. Resolving the above graph-theoretic problems would facilitate analyses of linked-reads sequencing data, through enabling the conceptual separation of barcodes into molecules and providing, through the molecules order, a skeleton for accurately assembling the genome. Here, we propose a framework that takes as input an arbitrary intersection graph (such as an overlap graph of barcodes) and constructs a heuristic approximation of the ordering of the original intervals.},
